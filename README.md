ntroduction to Wireshark and PCAP Files
What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a free, open-source network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze packets from network traffic in real time or from saved capture files (PCAP files).
What are PCAP Files?
PCAP (Packet Capture) files are data files that store network packet information. These files allow users to view past network traffic, ideal for post-event analysis and network forensics.
How to Use Wireshark in Forensics?
Wireshark helps detect patterns of abnormal activity by visualizing packet flow, tracking application layer communications, and identifying potential attack signatures.
